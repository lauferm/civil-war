    <h1>Confederacy's Expectations of European Support</h1>
    <p>At the start of the American Civil War, the Confederacy and General Robert E. Lee believed that the European powers, particularly Britain and France, would support their cause. The Confederacy hoped that Europe would recognize the legitimacy of the Confederate government and extend diplomatic recognition. They also believed that European powers would provide military aid and supplies, and even intervene on their behalf in the conflict.</p>
    <p>One of the reasons the Confederacy had such expectations was that the European powers were reliant on Southern cotton for their textile mills and the Confederacy believed that the Europeans would not want to risk losing access to this important resource. Additionally, there was a belief among the Confederacy that the European powers would support them due to a shared opposition to abolition and a desire to maintain the institution of slavery.</p>
    <p>However, these expectations were not fulfilled as the European powers ultimately remained neutral in the conflict and did not extend official recognition to the Confederacy. Despite this, the Confederacy continued to hope for European intervention, right up until the end of the war.</p><br>
