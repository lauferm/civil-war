    <h1>Battle of Fort Sumter</h1>
    <p>The Battle of Fort Sumter was the first battle of the American Civil War, fought on April 12-13, 1861. The battle was between Confederate forces and Union forces and took place at Fort Sumter, located in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
    <p>The conflict began when Confederate troops under General P.G.T. Beauregard opened fire on the Union-held fort, with the goal of forcing its surrender. After a 34-hour bombardment, the Union forces under Major Robert Anderson surrendered the fort, effectively beginning the American Civil War.</p>
    <p>The Battle of Fort Sumter was a key moment in the Civil War, as it marked the formal beginning of hostilities between the North and South. The outcome of the battle also signaled that the Confederacy was willing to use force to secede from the Union.</p>

    <p>Both the Union and Confederacy had their own advantages and disadvantages. The South had many experienced military officers who had served in the United States Army, giving them a strategic advantage in terms of training and tactics. Additionally, the South was known for its superior artillery, with many skilled artillerymen and a well-stocked arsenal.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the North had a significant advantage in terms of numbers and resources. The North had a larger population and a more developed industrial base, which allowed them to produce weapons and supplies on a much larger scale. The Union also had a larger and better-equipped army, making them well-prepared for a long and sustained conflict.</p>

    <p>Despite these advantages, both sides had different expectations at the start of the war. The Confederacy believed that they could win a quick and decisive victory, relying on their superior tactics and artillery to defeat the Union army. Meanwhile, the Union believed that they could win a long and grueling war of attrition, using their superior numbers and resources to gradually wear down the Confederate army.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the Civil War proved to be a long and brutal conflict, with both sides suffering heavy losses and facing numerous challenges. Nevertheless, the Union's advantage in numbers and resources proved to be a decisive factor, allowing them to ultimately win the war and preserve the unity of the United States.</p>
