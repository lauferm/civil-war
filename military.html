  <h1>Civil War: Military Overview</h1>
  <p>The American Civil War was fought from 1861 to 1865 and was one of the deadliest wars in American history. The conflict was mainly centered around the issue of slavery, with the Confederacy (composed of southern states) fighting to maintain the institution of slavery, while the Union (composed of northern states) sought to abolish it. The war resulted in the abolition of slavery, and had a profound impact on the country in terms of military strategy, tactics, and technology.</p><br>
