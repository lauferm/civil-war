  <h1>The Battle of Gettysburg</h1>
  <p>The Battle of Gettysburg was fought from July 1 to July 3, 1863, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was the largest and bloodiest battle of the American Civil War, with over 50,000 casualties. The battle was a turning point in the war, as Union forces emerged victorious and were able to push back Confederate advances in the North.</p>
  <p>The battle was preceded by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North in June of 1863. Lee's goal was to spread out Union forces and win a decisive victory that would pressure the North to negotiate a peace settlement. In response, Union General George G. Meade was ordered to defend the region and engage Lee's forces.</p>
  <p>The first day of the battle saw Confederate forces push Union forces back into the town of Gettysburg. The second day of battle saw intense fighting, with both sides struggling for control of Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill. On the third day, Lee ordered a massive infantry assault on the center of the Union line, known as Pickett's Charge. The charge was repulsed by Union forces, and Confederate troops were forced to retreat back to Virginia.</p>
  <p>The Battle of Gettysburg resulted in over 23,000 Confederate casualties and over 28,000 Union casualties. The Union victory at Gettysburg ended Lee's invasion of the North and marked a significant turning point in the war. The battle also had a lasting impact on American society and culture, as Gettysburg became a symbol of the sacrifices made during the war and a site of pilgrimage for veterans and their families.</p><br>
