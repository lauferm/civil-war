  <h1>Political and Strategic Considerations</h1>
  <p>The American Civil War was not just a military conflict, but also a political and strategic one. The North and the South had different political ideologies, with the North being largely Republican and supportive of a strong federal government, while the South was primarily Democratic and in favor of states' rights. This political division was a major factor in the eventual outbreak of the war. Additionally, both sides had different strategies for how to win the war. The Union was focused on blockade and destruction of Confederate infrastructure, while the Confederacy aimed to hold out long enough to force the North to negotiate a peace treaty.</p>
