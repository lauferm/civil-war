  <h1>The Battle of Vicksburg</h1>
  <p>The Battle of Vicksburg was fought from May 18 to July 4, 1863, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. It was a major turning point in the American Civil War, as Union forces were able to capture the Confederate stronghold and gain control of the Mississippi River. The victory at Vicksburg effectively split the Confederacy in half and gave the Union a major advantage in the war.</p>
  <p>The battle was part of a larger Union campaign to gain control of the Mississippi River and cut off Confederate supplies and communication. Union General Ulysses S. Grant was tasked with capturing Vicksburg and breaking the Confederate hold on the river. After several failed attempts to take the city by force, Grant decided to lay siege to the city and cut off its supplies.</p>
  <p>The siege of Vicksburg lasted for over 40 days, with Union forces bombarding the city and digging trenches to isolate Confederate forces. Despite attempts by Confederate General John C. Pemberton to break the siege, Union forces were able to maintain their position and eventually forced the surrender of the Confederate garrison.</p>
  <p>The Battle of Vicksburg resulted in over 10,000 Confederate casualties and over 1,700 Union casualties. It was a major victory for the Union and helped solidify their control of the Mississippi River and the western theater of the war. The battle also had a significant impact on the outcome of the war, as the Union's control of the river allowed them to cut off Confederate supplies and communication and effectively split the Confederacy in two.</p>
