  <h1 id="battle-of-bull-run">Battle of Bull Run--Communications</h1>
  <p>Standard military communication procedures during the time of the Civil War included the use of messengers on horseback, signal flags, and drum or bugle signals.</p>

  <p>Messengers were used to carry orders and messages between commanders in the field. Signal flags and torches were used to communicate visually over long distances, while drum or bugle signals were used to communicate auditory commands. The use of these methods allowed for the rapid transfer of information and coordination of troops during the Battle of Bull Run.</p>

  <p>The Confederate army was comprised of many former military officers who were familiar with these standard military communication procedures, which contributed to their successful communication during the battle.</p>
