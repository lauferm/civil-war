  <h1>Causes of the American Civil War</h1>
  <p>The American Civil War was fought between 1861 and 1865 and was one of the most significant events in American history. The war was a result of a long-standing conflict between the North and the South over a variety of issues, including slavery, states' rights, and economic differences. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 was a major catalyst for the start of the war. Lincoln was a strong opponent of slavery and many in the South feared that he would try to abolish it.
