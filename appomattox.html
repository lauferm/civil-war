    <h1>Surrender at Appomotax</h1>
    <p>The American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, was a turning point in the history of the United States. The conflict, which arose over states' rights and slavery, resulted in the defeat of the Confederacy and the preservation of the Union.</p>
    <p>The effective surrender of the Confederacy came about as a result of several key battles and events. The Union army, under the leadership of General Ulysses S. Grant, launched a series of successful offensives in the Eastern and Western theaters of the war. These offensives put pressure on the Confederate army and made it difficult for them to maintain their hold on key territories and cities.</p>
    <p>In addition to the military offensives, the Union also implemented a successful naval blockade of the Confederate coastline, which limited the ability of the Confederacy to receive supplies and reinforcements from abroad. This, combined with the Union's control of the Mississippi River, effectively cut the Confederacy in two, making it difficult for them to coordinate their efforts and respond to the Union's advances.</p>
    <p>On April 9, 1865, General Robert E. Lee, the commander of the Confederate army, surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. This effectively ended the fighting in the Eastern Theater and marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War.</p>
    <p>In the weeks and months that followed, other Confederate forces surrendered and the Union army gradually took control of the remaining Confederate territories. The effective surrender of the Confederacy marked the end of the deadliest war in American history and paved the way for the rebuilding of the nation and the abolition of slavery.</p>
